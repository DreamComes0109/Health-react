          International nurses play a vital role in the U.S. healthcare system,
          contributing to the delivery of high-quality care to patients across
          the country. The shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in
          certain regions and specialties, has led to a growing demand for
          international nurses to fill critical gaps in the workforce.
          International nurses bring with them unique perspectives and
          experiences that enrich the healthcare industry and help to improve
          patient outcomes.

              As an international nurse, there are many opportunities to pursue
              a rewarding career in the U.S. healthcare system. There are
              positions available for a wide range of nursing specialties,
              including medical-surgical nursing, critical care nursing,
              emergency nursing, pediatrics, oncology, and many others. Whether
              you have recently graduated or you are an experienced nurse, there
              are opportunities for you to advance your career and expand your
              skills.
