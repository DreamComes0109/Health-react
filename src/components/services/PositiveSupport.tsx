            Positive Behavioral Support (PBS) is a holistic approach that aims
            to improve quality of life while reducing undesirable behaviors.
            This is achieved by replacing negative behaviors with newly acquired
            skills and proactively eliminating triggering events from the
            individual's environment. PBS is an evolving methodology that draws
            inspiration from applied behavior analysis, person-centered values,
            and the normalization/inclusion movement. Its ultimate goal is to
            create a lifestyle that promotes positive behavior and enhances
            overall well-being.

          <p>
            Our aim is to assist individuals in achieving the life they desire
            by fostering a therapeutic environment that incorporates
            person-centered practices and positive behavior supports. We
            strongly encourage active engagement from both the individual and
            their team in developing a personalized behavior plan. Furthermore,
            we firmly believe that a person-centered plan serves as the
            foundation of the process and informs the behavior support plan.
